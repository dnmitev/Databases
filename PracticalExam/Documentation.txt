Connection string for "Company" database: (location)
	I've used SQL Server 2012, be that kind to change the connection string in the app.config files, if you are using an EXPRESS version
	
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="CompanyEntities" connectionString="metadata=res://*/CompanyModel.csdl|res://*/CompanyModel.ssdl|res://*/CompanyModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=.;initial catalog=Company;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework&quot;" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
  </connectionStrings>

Connection string for "Cars" database: (location)
	Connection string is set in every app.config file for using the SQL Server, there is also an SQL Server EXPRESS connection string,
	but so kind and check if it is correct. To use the express connection string just comment the one above.
	
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="CarsConnection" connectionString="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Cars;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
