1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

	SQL: a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
	DML: A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a
	database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.
	Most important SQL commands: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER
   
2. What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?

	Transact-SQL (T-SQL): Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a standardized computer
	language that was originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include
	procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. These
	additional features make Transact-SQL Turing complete
